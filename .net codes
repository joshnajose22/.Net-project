.Net core is a cross platform, free and open source development framework primarily developed by Microsoft
Supports OS such as Windows, Linux and MacOS for both development and deployment
Applications for variety of devices like desktop, mobile and tablets ca be developed. It also supports application development for clound or iot.

Features:
Consistent across architecture- .net core apps have same behaviour on multiple architecture(x64bit, x86bit or ARM)
Modular with small packages called NuGet packages-help to optimize apps
Provide command-line tools-useful for local development and continuous integration
Compatabe with .net framework, xamerin and mono via .net standard
Supports applications and library creation using languages c#, vb.net and f#
Command line interface and IDEs- Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, VS for Mac

Deployments
1) Framework-dependant deployment- require .net core to be installed on the machine app will run
                                 - apps and libraries have only their own code alongwith any 3rd party dependancies that are outside of .net core libraries
                                 - apps are portable and can run on any OS without any modification
2) Self-contained deployment= app contains everything it needs to run on
                            - apps and libraries have only their own code plus .net core liraries and runtimewithin the application
                            - apps can be published as an OS-Specific version of the app
3) Framework dependant executables- produce executables(.exe file) that run on a target platform
                                  - not self-contained
                                  - app contains only code and any 3rd party dependancies that are outside of .net core libraries
                                  
How different is .net framework from .net core?
.net framework was released as a licensed and proprietary software framework those subsequently only a few components were made open source
.net core was released as an open source software framework
